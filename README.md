Automatic Calibration implementation of easy_handeye: TF / VISP Hand-Eye Calibration
============================================ 

This is an edit to the [Easy Handy-Eye calibration program] ("https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye") to create an automatic calibration program for the HIRO Sawyer robot. 

This utilizes the eye-on-base implementation of the program using an Intel RealSense camera mounted on the ceiling above Sawyer.


## Getting started
These are the same basic steps for implementation of Easy Hand-Eye.

- clone this repository into your catkin workspace:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src  # replace with path to your workspace
git clone https://github.com/HIRO-group/easy_handeyee
```

- satisfy dependencies
```
cd ..  # now we are inside ~/catkin_ws
rosdep install -iyr --from-paths src
```

- build
```
catkin build
```

## Calibration

There are a couple of steps before we can start using the automatic calibration
* Connect to the HIROLab_5G wifi network
* Plug the Intel RealSense camera cable into your machine
* Turn on Sawyer

For all terminal tabs used:
* Enter your intera workspace:
```
cd catkin_ws
./intera.sh
```
* Easy Hand-Eye runs on Python 2. To check your python version, run:
```
python
```
 If the version shows 3.X, you can set up a [temporary Python 2 environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7237415/python-2-instead-of-python-3-as-the-temporary-default-python)
 
 
#### Launching 
* Launch the sawyer_realsense launch file:
```
cd src/easy_handeye/easy_handeye/launch/
roslaunch sawyer_realsense_handeyecalibration.launch 
```
This should launch Rviz Easy Hand-Eye Config and RQT Easy Hand-Eye Perspective. These are the GUIs used to perform a manual calibration with Easy Hand-Eye.

#### Intel RealSense Camera Image
* Open another terminal tab (making sure to enter into the intera workspace and run Python 2) and show the Intel RealSense camera image:
```
rosservice call /sawyer_realsense_handeyecalibration_eye_on_base/take_sample â€“ takes sample using rosservices 
```
#### Run the Automatic Calibration
* Navigate to the automatic calibration and run the script:
```
cd easy_handeye/rqt_easy_handeye/src/rqt_easy_handeye/
./automatic_calibration.py 
```
